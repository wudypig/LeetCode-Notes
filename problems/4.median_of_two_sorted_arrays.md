Due to this problem ask for time complexity `O(lon(M+N))`,
means we have to use **Binary Search**.

The center index `m1 = (l + r) / 2`.
The max `r` is equal to n1 so `r = n1 = 6`.
Due to the max `r`, the max `l = r - 1 = 5`.

Started from `l = 0`, and `r = n1 = 6`.
So that we can find the center index `m1 = (0 + 6) / 2 = 3`.
We know the `k = m1 + m2 = 7`, so `m2 = 4`.
However, `a[m1] < b[m2-1]`, `l` needs to be moved to right.

Because we use **Binary Search**,
`l` needs to move to the right of original center `l = m1 + 1 = 4`.
`r` is still on the `6`, and we can get new `m1 = (l + r) / 2 = 5`
and new `m2 = k - m1 = 2`.

Follow the steps, we will stop at `l = 4`, and `r = 4`.
At this time, the `m1 = 4`, and the `m2 = 3`.
So that we can get the `a[m1] = 7` and `b[m2-1] = 6`.
<code>C<sub>k-1</sub> = max(A<sub>m1-1</sub>, B<sub>m2-1</sub>) = 6</code>
<code>C<sub>k-1</sub> = min(A<sub>m1</sub>, B<sub>m2</sub>) = 7</code>
<code>median = (C<sub>k-1</sub> + C<sub>k-1</sub>) / 2 = 6.5</code>
